Diabetes Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive and comprehensive analytical overview of diabetes-related health factors using patient biometric and medical data. It helps explore relationships between BMI, glucose levels, age, blood pressure, and other clinical indicators that contribute to diabetes risk.

Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is divided into multiple analytical sections designed to give data scientists, healthcare professionals, and researchers valuable insights into diabetes prevalence and risk factors.

1. KPI Cards

•Total Patients: 768

•Average BMI: 31.99

•Average Glucose Level: 120.89

•Average Skin Thickness: 20.54

These KPIs summarize the overall health metrics across the dataset.

Dashboard Visuals & Insights
1. Risk of Getting Diabetes (Donut Chart)

Shows the distribution of patients categorized into:

•High Risk

•Medium Risk

•Low Risk

Each slice includes both patient count and percentage contribution.

2. Average Glucose by Age (Line Chart)

•A dynamic visualization showing how glucose levels fluctuate across age groups.
Helps identify whether advancing age correlates with elevated glucose levels.

3. Count of BMI by BMI Category (Pie Chart)

Breaks down patient BMI values into categories:

•Obese

•Overweight

•Normal

•Underweight

Displays the count and percentage for each category.

4. Diabetes Risk % and Scaled Target (Gauge Chart)

•A gauge visualization representing:

•The overall Diabetes Risk Percentage

•The scaled target level for comparison
•Includes a textual indicator (e.g., High).

5. Age & BMI-wise Blood Pressure (Matrix Table)

A detailed matrix comparing:

•Age Category (30–50, High Age, Less than 30)
with

•BMI Category (Normal, Obese, Overweight, Underweight)

•Displays average blood pressure across each combination, along with row and column totals.

6. Blood Pressure by Age (Bar Chart)

Horizontal bars showing the average blood pressure for specific age ranges.
Useful for spotting trends in hypertension risk with age progression.

 Filters
